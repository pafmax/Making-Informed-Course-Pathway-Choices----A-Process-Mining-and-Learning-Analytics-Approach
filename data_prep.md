## Data preparation and Aquisition

As commented before, the data came form the university data warehouse and comprises 53 variables. This data was stored in a SQLite database and modelling was primarily performed using R 3.3.2 and RStudio IDE. Modelling was also performed using KNIME 3.2.1.
In order to perform process mining, PRoM 6.2 and Disco were used on extracts of the dataset.
In order to build our interactive tool, we used Shiny, a [try to define it?] extension to R by RStudio that allows the HTML visualisation and hosting of analytics dashboards.
The data was pre-processed for process mining and modelling, by removing or modifiying outliers and null values, but not for the use in the tool, as it is built to filter and deal with those values.
