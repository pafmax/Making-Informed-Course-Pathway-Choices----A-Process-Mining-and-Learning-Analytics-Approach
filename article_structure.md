## Abstract

## Introduction

### Literature review

Talk about:
* process mining
* educational process mining
* Concept drift
* complexity
* other attempts

### Scope

* Major university
* Complete database
* holistic view
* focus on the end user

### Our data

* Six million events
* 300k students
* 50 years
* 1200 courses
* 16k subjects

### Our problem with our data

* Veracity
* Variance in course structure
* Size
* end-user

## Data Preparation and Aquisition

* Describe the Methods
* Describe R and Shiny
* Talk of the cleansing process

## Results

* Show how it is difficult to do a single path
* Describe complexity in the spaguetti models
* Talk of our solution: analytical dashboard
* show our solution process
* Describe our system

## Discussion

* Other's issues are the same as ours
* larger volume = more difficulties
* greater difficulties = worse user experience
* more user-friendly
* education not really a process in process mining terms
* simpler solution adds more value to the usage acceptance
* how a notion becomes more usefull than the raw data (find stuff about this topic)
* simpler solution adds more value
* how a notion becomes more usefull than the 
* exploration tool
* not a precise analytical tool
* we don't completeley know the nature of the outliers
* we keep the issues because they are not relevant on the larger scale (refs)


## Conclusions

* Difficult to do process mining in this document
* USer-friendly alternative for exploration
* better value
