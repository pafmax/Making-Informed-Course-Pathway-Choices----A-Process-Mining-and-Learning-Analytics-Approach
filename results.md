# Results

* Show how it is difficult to do a single path
* Describe complexity in the spaguetti models
* Talk of our solution: analytical dashboard
* show our solution process
* Describe our system

This section will be divided into two parts: Mining and Visualising. In the mining part we will reveal our results for the process mining of subsets of the data, in the visualising we will present our tool.

[think about how to go with it, should I show the model, just go through to process mining directly?]
